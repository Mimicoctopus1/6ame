# 3D renderer:
For 3D rendering, I use a custom renderer that is as simple as possible, with many plugins. It may, however, be confusing if you don't understand a vector. A vector is basically an object with 3 properties: x, y, and z. These properties give the vectors position in 3D space.

So let's say my camera is here, and I want to see this triangle in 3D.

Why a triangle? Because you can make any geometrical shape out of triangles! Take this cat face for example
