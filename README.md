# OJVJPJ.game

## Inside Code

*   index.js renders public/index.html, which imports public/index.css.
*   Uses socket.io for websocket API (for lack of better resources). Brief socket.io explanation can be found in the
    [socket.io-explanation folder](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/ojvjpjgame?path=socket.io-explanation%2Fserver.js%3A1%3A0).
* .env is the environment variables (secrets) file.
* .gitignore tells which files for git to ignore (IDK what this means if you can clarify in the comments that would be nice)
* .prettierrc is my [PRETTIER](https://prettier.io) format. If you would like to use the default PRETTIER format, simply delete 
the .prettierrc file and it will use the same format as Glitch.
* LICENSE is the MIT LICENSE document.
* README.md is this file, which explains everything about this repository.
* package.json is the file in every Node.js repo that explains what you need to run it, how it imports, what it imports,
its version number, name, and description.
